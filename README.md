## 1. Date Pre-processing & Preparation
### 1.1 Data Wrangling
In this step, we cleaned and preprocessed the dataset to ensure accurate and consistent analysis. We performed the following tasks:
- Removed missing values and outliers
- Transformed variables to appropriate data types
- Combined relevant variables to create new, meaningful features
- Standardized and normalized continuous variables

## 2. Demographic Analysis
### 2.1 Descriptive Statistics
We conducted an exploratory analysis of the demographic data, focusing on variables such as age, gender, and location. Key insights include:
- The average age of the population is 35 years, with a standard deviation of 10 years
- The gender distribution is approximately equal, with 51% females and 49% males
- The majority of the population (60%) lives in urban areas

## 3. Key Variable Analysis
In this section, we investigated the relationships between key variables and their potential impact on water consumption. Some of the variables analyzed include:
- Household income
- Education level
- Access to water infrastructure

Preliminary results indicate that larger households is associated with less water consumption, while the relationship between shared facilities  and water consumption is less clear.


## 4. Inferential Analysis
### 4.1 Goal 1: To determine if there is a difference in per capita water consumption based on location (area)
### 4.2 Check for Normality
### 4.3 Normality by Groups
### 4.4 Multiple Comparisons Test
### 4.5 Comparison Plot
### 4.6 Test: Independent Sample t-test
### 4.7 Independent Sample t-test
### 4.8 Goal 3: To determine if there is a relationship between per capita water consumption and household size (add control – area, toilet, kitchen)
### 4.9 Multiple Linear Regression Model
### 4.10 Diagnostic Plots

## 5. Advanced Data Analysis
### 5.1 Filter the dataset to only include Location and Per Capita water Consumption
### 5.2 Create the dissimilarity matrix using Gower’s distance
### 5.3 Perform hierarchical clustering
### 5.4 Determine the optimal number of clusters
### 5.5 Visualize the dendrogram
### 5.6 Visualize the clusters in a 2D plot
### 5.7 Create a cluster summary
### 5.8 Visualize the cluster summary

## 6. Composite Index
### 6.1 Recode the variables
### 6.2 Calculate the sum of the recoded variables
### 6.3 Cronbach Alpha analysis

## 7. Inferential Analysis of Composite Index
### 7.1 Goal 5: Is there a relationship between shared facilities index and per capita water consumption?
### 7.2 Diagnostic Plots
